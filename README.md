# Python OOP Practice

Beginner-friendly Python projects built to learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) step by step.

## What I Built

### 1) Bank Account (`bank_account.py`)
- Create accounts with owner and balance
- Deposit, withdraw, transfer money
- Validate invalid operations

### 2) Student Grade Tracker (`student_tracker.py`)
- Store student grades
- Calculate average, highest, lowest
- Show pass/fail report

### 3) Library Manager (`library_manager.py`)
- Two-class design: `Library` + `Book`
- Add, issue, return, remove books
- Prevent removing issued books

### 4) Inventory System (`inventory_system.py`)
- Inheritance with `Item`, `ElectronicItem`, `GroceryItem`
- Method overriding (`show_info`)
- Discount support (`apply_discount`)

### 5) Quiz App (`quiz_app.py`)
- `Question` and `Quiz` classes
- User input based quiz flow
- Score and final result

## OOP Concepts Practiced
- Classes and objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (overriding)
- Input validation and state updates

## Run Locally

```bash
python bank_account.py
python student_tracker.py
python library_manager.py
python inventory_system.py
python quiz_app.py
